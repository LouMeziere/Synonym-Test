# Evaluation of Multiple Corpus using Word2Vec 
This project aims to create a model that determines the best synonym out of 4 options from a given question word. The method by which the best synonym is determined is by using the cosine similarity between two words and outputing the word with the highest score. Ultimately, the goal is to compare whether a Bag of Word model's prediction perform better than a human goal-standard.

The project was divided into the following tasks:
    -Task 1 uses a given google-news corpus
    -Task 2 involves 4 pre-trained models, of varying corpus sizes coming from different sources
    -Task 3 trains 4 new models with different window and embedding sizes.
